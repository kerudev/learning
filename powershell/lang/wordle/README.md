# powershell/lang/wordle

In this project I learned how to:
- Use basic control structures (`if`, `else`, `foreach`, `do while`...)
- Use all kinds of operators (`-eq`, `-ne`, `-is`).
- Use data structures (`Array`, `HashSet` and `Hashtable`).
- Manage files (reading, writing, counting lines...)
- Document functions using `param` and `OutputType`.
- Make REST API calls.
- Create and use constants and global variables.

The help command is `Get-Help ./Wordle.ps1`.

Run with `./Wordle.ps1 [COMMAND]`:
- `-Play`: play the game.
- `-Add <String>`: adds a word to the game's dictionary.
- `-Reset`: resets the game's dictionary.
