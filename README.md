# ðŸ“š learning

This repo contains small projects and code snippets I've used to learn
programming languages or libraries I'm interested in.

## What I want to learn

### Python
- **pandas**: data analysis. Uses DataFrames (table-like structures) as the core component. 
  - Docs: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/

### Rust
- **serde**: I've worked with it on a surface level, but I want to know it more in depth.
  - Home: https://serde.rs/

- **tokio**: really popular on the Rust community. Would be helpful to reinforce my concurrency knowledge.
  - Home: https://tokio.rs/

### C
- **OpenGL**: I'm interested in rendering graphics.
  - Home: https://www.opengl.org/

- **Raylib**: I've heard not a single bad comment about it. 
  - Home: https://www.raylib.com/

- **Clay**: modern layout library. Can render with raylib, WebGL, etc. 
  - Home: https://www.nicbarker.com/clay

### Web
- **NextJS**: similar to React, but with backend management too.
  - Home: https://nextjs.org/
  - Docs: https://nextjs.org/learn

- **WebGL**: graphics engine in the browser.
  - Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API

### Zig
- I've always been curious about it.
  - Home: https://ziglang.org/
  - Docs: https://ziglang.org/learn/
  - Book: https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/

### Go
- I want to know why it got so popular and explore it!
  - Home: https://go.dev/
  - Docs: https://go.dev/learn/

### Arduino
- Planning on buying a starter kit soon, as that stuff interests me and I want
to dip my toes into embedded programming.

### assembly
- Why not?
- I'd like to learn the NASM (Intel) before GAS (AT&T).
  - Docs (syscalls x86_64): https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/

### Others
- Maybe I'll tinker with V or Odin some day.
