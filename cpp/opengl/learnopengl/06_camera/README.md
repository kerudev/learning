# cpp/opengl/learnopengl/06_camera

Example and exercises from https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera

In this project I learned how to:
- Use matrices to control the `camera`.
- Move the camera in the `x`, `y` and `z` axes.
- Zoom the camera in and out.

Compile with `make all`.

Get a list of all available examples using `./build/main --help`.

For example: `./build/main ch1`
