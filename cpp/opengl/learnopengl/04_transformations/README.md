# cpp/opengl/learnopengl/04_transformations

Example and exercises from https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Transformations

In this project I learned how to:
- Do basic math operations with vectors and matrices.
- Use the GLM library (https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/)

Compile with `make all`.

Get a list of all available examples using `./build/main --help`.

For example: `./build/main ch1`
