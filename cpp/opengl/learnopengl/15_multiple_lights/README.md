# cpp/opengl/learnopengl/13_lighting_maps

Example and exercises from https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Multiple-lights

In this project I learned how to:
- Work with multiple light sources.
- Work with multiple types of light (DirLight, PointLight, SpotLight).
- Make the flashlight turn on and off.

The tutorial shows a picture in which the light points are colored, but the
code doesn't show you how to do that. I tweaked it to match the picture.

Press F to turn the flashlight on and off.

Compile with `make all`.

Get a list of all available examples using `./build/main --help`.

For example: `./build/main mat1`
