- Use slices and maps.
- Use the append function.
- Define basic structs.
- Define functions with arguments and return types.
- Return and handle errors.
- Make an HTTP request and receive its response.
- Open, read and write files in different formats (txt, csv, json, xml)
- Serialize and deserialize data (json, xml)
