# rust/ratatui/user-input

In this project I learned how to:
- Use the `IndexMap` from the `indexmap` dependency.
- Use `ratatui`'s widgets, text components, layout elements, styles...
- Create a draw loop.
- Create a simple CRUD program.
- Map keys to an action when they are pressed.
- Control the cursor's position.

Run with `cargo run`.
