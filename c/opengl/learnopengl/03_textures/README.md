# c/opengl/learnopengl/03_textures

Example and exercises from https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Textures

In this project I learned how to:
- Bind and use textures.
- Load and use images as `textures` using [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h).
- Use different `texture filtering` methods.
- Use different `texture wrapping` methods.
- Generate `mipmaps` based on a texture.

Compile with `make all`.

Get a list of all available examples using `./build/main --help`.\
Use the `--wall` flag to change the background texture.

For example: `./build/main tex1`\
For example: `./build/main ex1 --wall`
