In this project I learned how to:
- Setup VSCode to work with Arduino ([PlatformIO](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)).
- Use the setup and loop functions.
- Set digital pins to be inputs or outputs.
- Read from and write to digital pins.

Components used:
- 1 switch
- 2 red LEDs
- 1 green LEDs
- 3 220 Ohm resistors
- 1 10k Ohm resistor
