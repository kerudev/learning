# arduino/book/02_spaceship_interface

In this project I learned how to:
- Setup VSCode to work with Arduino ([PlatformIO](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)).
- Use the setup and loop functions.
- Set digital pins to be inputs or outputs.
- Read from and write to digital pins.
