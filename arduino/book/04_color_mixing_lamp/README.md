# arduino/book/04_color_mixing_lamp

In this project I learned how to:
- Take input from the analog pins and write output through the digital pins.
- Use phototransistors with colored plastic sheets to filter wavelengths.
- Use light intensity received by the phototransistors to light up an RGB LED.

Components used:
- 1 RGB LED
- 3 phototransistors
- 3 220 Ohm resistors
- 3 10k Ohm resistors
- Red, green and blue color plastic sheets
